**Overall goal of the project**

The overall goal of our project is to classify wine based on content of fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density,pH, sulphates,alcohol into quality groups. Also, the purpose is to apply learnings from the DTU 02476 course in a context of group work with 4 students collaborating on this project.



**What framework are you going to use, and you do you intend to include the framework into your project?**

We are going to use the Pytorch Tabular framework. The reason is the very simple dataset and simple ML task, so that we can focus on the ML-Ops tasks.


**What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)**

We are using Willian Oliveira Gibin's https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset "Wine Quality Dataset". This is a simple tabular dataset of 1124 observations in 12 dimensions of wine contents and quality. The dataset includes subjective assessment of wine quality "quality"-column.



What models do you expect to use
We intend to fit a simple ML-model for this exercise. We have chosen this and a minimal dataset to focus on the learnings in the course regarding ML-Ops. Our problem at hand is close to a regression problem, nonetheless we intend to use the ML-Ops-stack from the course.
